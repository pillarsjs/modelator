# Modelator

## For reasons of time and advancement in technologies, especially JS, this project is no longer maintained.
### Thank you for your support and interest in this project.

We personally think this is a good example of simplifying JS code in Node for these purposes and hopefully we'll have enough time to come back to this idea or something similar.

This project has favored great relationships and has provided a lot of learning for its participants

See you later! <3
